# Budget Tracker(Progressive Web App)

## **Usage**

This app utilizes MongoDB and Mongoose to keep track of your budget and works both online and offline.

## **Description**

This application allows the user to track their expenses whether they have an internet connection or not. Being a Progressive Web App, the user is able to download the app and launch it from an icon on their laptop, tablet, or phone. The offline mode works because the service worker caches the data to Indexed DB and once back online, syncs up with the Mongo Atlas DB.

## **Link**

The app is deployed on Heroku [here](https://budget-tracker-pcp.herokuapp.com/).
